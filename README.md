## About me
### _"The best way to predict the future is to create it"_
I'm a full-time software engineer :) always learning, always thinking of new things to do
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m working on a video game with my friends  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C#
- âš¡ Fun fact: One of the oldest paintings found in human history is [45,500 years old](https://news.artnet.com/art-world/indonesia-pig-art-oldest-painting-1937110)!
